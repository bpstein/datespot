Following suit is The Wells basement bar in Clerkenwell, who together with Buffalo Chase bourbon are throwing a pickle-themed party for autumn. Wooden crates and Victorian picture frames look coincidentally left down here  and this mish-mash decor creates a cosy hideaway for the whisky enthused.Slouching in comfy sofas between bespoke ornaments, The Pickle Jar encourages private parties or drop-ins to sink traditional Pickle Back shots made up of smooth bourbon and a crisp pickle juice chaser  choose from beetroot, cucumber or gherkin. The two-shot combination results in a shocking sweetness that enlivens the tastes of the bourbon. Longer shrub cocktails replace the acidity of lemon and lime with a splash of vinegar to adjust the sweetness created from the base of your drink: be it sloe berry, apricot or raspberry. Other, more typical NY cocktails are available if vinegars not your thing, and for larger parties, sliders can be booked with your drinks. The Pickle Jar is a bourbon-drinkers paradise in the basement of a Clerkenwell fave, and a perfect excuse to get pickled this autumn. - See more at: http:\/\/www.justopenedlondon.com\/the-pickle-jar-at-the-well\/sthash.9UJe9GRZ.dpuf",
